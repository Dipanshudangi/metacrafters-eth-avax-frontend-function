Simple Contract Project:

This project demonstrates a basic integration between a smart contract and a React.js frontend.
The smart contract is deployed using Hardhat, and the React.js application interacts with the contract to display its values.

Project Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to provide a simple example of how to:

1.Create a smart contract with basic functions.
2.Deploy the contract using Hardhat.
3.Interact with the deployed contract using a React.js frontend.

Project Structure:

contracts/: Contains the Solidity smart contract(s).
scripts/: Scripts for deploying the contract(s).
frontend/: Contains the React.js application.
README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions.

Smart Contract:

The smart contract contains 2-3 basic functions. Below is a simple example:

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleContract {
    uint256 public value;

    constructor(uint256 _initialValue) {
        value = _initialValue;
    }

    function setValue(uint256 _newValue) public {
        value = _newValue;
    }

    function getValue() public view returns (uint256) {
        return value;
    }
}

Deployment:

To deploy the smart contract, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies:
   npm install
   
2.Compile the smart contract:
npx hardhat compile

3.Deploy the contract:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>

Frontend:
The React.js frontend interacts with the deployed contract and displays the values of its functions.

Usage:
1.After starting the frontend, you should see the current value from the contract displayed on the webpage.
2.Use the provided form to update the value in the contract.
